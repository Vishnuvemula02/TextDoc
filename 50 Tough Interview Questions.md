50 Tough Interview Questions
You and Your Accomplishments
1. Tell me a little about yourself.
Because this is often the opening question, be careful that you don’t run off at the mouth.
Keep your answer to a minute or two, and consider four topics:
• Early Years
• Education
• Work History
• Recent Career Experience
2. What can you do for us that some else can’t?
Here you have every right and perhaps obligation to toot your own horn and be a bit
egotistical.
• Talk about your record of getting things done.
• Mention specifics from your resume or inventory of accomplishments
• Say that your skills and interests, combined with history of getting things done, makes
you valuable.
• Mention ability to set priorities, identify problems, and use your experience and ability to
solve them.
3. Why should we hire you?
Create your answer by thinking in terms of your ability, your experience, and your energy.
See Question 2 for more detail.
4. What do you look for in a job?
Keep you answer oriented toward the opportunities at the organization.
• Talk about desire to perform and be recognized for contributions
• Orient your answer toward opportunities rather than personal security
5. How long would it take you to make a meaningful contribution to our firm?
Be realistic.
• Say that, while you would expect to meet pressing demands and pull your own weight
from the first day, it might take six months to a year before you could expect to know the
organization and its needs enough to make a major contribution.
6. Did you change the nature of your job?
Tell how you improved it.
7. Can you work under pressure and deal with deadlines?
Observe that both are facts of business life.
• Take examples from your list of accomplishments to show how you have dealt
successfully with pressure and deadlines in the past.
8. In your present (last) position, what problems did you identify that had previously been
overlooked?
Be brief and don’t brag. Indicate the positive changes your suggestions or leadership
resulting in.
9. If you could start your career over again what would you do differently?
The best answer is, “Not a thing.”
• You should try to present yourself as a person who is happy with his or her life.
• You’ve enjoyed its ups and learned from its downs.
• You would not, as a result, want to change things that brought you to where you are
today.
• Mention that it is the past, after all, that has prepared you for this position.
10. What career options do you have at this moment?
You should try to identify three areas of interest, one of which includes this company and job.
• The other two should be in related fields.
11. How would you define success?
Think in terms of a sense of well-being.
• Consider opportunity and responsibility as components of success.

36. Did you think of leaving your present position before? If so, what do you think held you

You might say that the challenge of the job held you in the past but, as that seemed to
diminish, you reached the decision to investigate new opportunities.
37. What do you think of your (former) boss?
Be as positive as you can.
• A potential boss will anticipate that you might talk about him or her in similar terms at
some point in the future.
38. Will you be out to take your boss’s job?
Say that while you certainly hope to win additional responsibility in the organization, you’ve
always focused on getting the current job done.
Strengths and Weaknesses
39. Would you describe a few situations in which your work was criticized?
Be specific. Don’t be emotional.
• Think in terms of constructive criticism
• Show that you responded positively and benefited from that criticism.
40. If I spoke with your (former) boss, what would he or she say are your greatest strengths
and weaknesses?
Name three or four strengths and only one weakness. Be honest but not negative.
41. What are your strong points?
Present at least three.
• Use concrete, work-related examples to illustrate them.
• Try to relate your answer to the interviewing organization and the specific job opening.
42. What are your weak points?
Don’t say you have none. But try to make a negative sound like a strength carried a bit to far.
• “I sometimes get impatient and become deeply involved when a project is running late.
• Don’t offer a list of weaknesses
• A good interviewer may press you a bit by saying, “Is there anything else?” You might
answer “No, I don’t think so on that topic.”
• If the interviewer persist, come up with a second weakness, but only if you are asked for
it. Don’t offer negative information unnecessarily.
• If the interviewer continues and asks for a third weakness, say politely that you really
can’t think of anything else.
• Finally, show that you are working to correct your weaknesses.
Salary-Related Questions
43. Why aren’t you earning more at your age?
Say that is one reason you’re conducting this job search. Don’t be defensive.
44. What do you feel this position should pay?
Salary is a delicate topic.
• We suggest that you defer tying yourself to a precise figure for as long as you can do it
politely.
• You might say, “I understand that the range for this job is between $X and $Y. That seem
appropriate for the job as I understand it.”
• You might answer the question with a question. “Perhaps you can help me on this one.
Can you tell me if there is a range for similar jobs in the organization?
• If you’re asked the question during an initial screening interview, you might say that you
feel you need to know more about the responsibilities involved before giving a
meaningful answer. Here too, either by asking the interviewer or doing research during
your investigation of the company, you can try to find out whether there is a salary grade
attached to the job. If there is, and if you can live with it, say that the range seems right
to you.
• If the interviewer continues to probe, you might say, “You know I am making $X now.
Like everyone else, I’d like to improve on that figure, but my major interest is in the job
itself.” Remember the act of taking a new job does not, in and of itself, make you worth
more money.
• If no price range is attached to the job, and the interviewer continues to press the subject,
then you will have to respond with a number. You can’t leave the impression that it
doesn’t really matter, that you’ll accept what ever is offered. If you’ve been making
$96,000 annually, you can’t say that a $42,000 figure would be fine without sounding
like you are giving up on yourself. (If you are making a radical career change, however,
a substantial disparity may be more reasonable and understandable)
• Don’t sell yourself short, but continue to stress the fact that the job itself is the most
important thing in your mind. The interviewer may be trying to determine just how much
you want the job. Don’t leave the impression that money is the only thing important to
you. Link questions of salary to the work itself.
• If a search firm is involved, your contact there may be able to help with the salary
question. A search firm representative may even be able to run interference for you. If,
for instance, this person tells you what the position pays, and you respond that you are
earning that amount now and would like to do a bit better, he or she might go back to the
employer and purpose that you be offered an additional ten percent.
• But, whenever possible, say as little as you can about salary until you reach the final
stage of the interviewing process. At that point, you know the company is genuinely
interested in you and is more likely to be flexible in salary negotiations.
Personality Traits
45. Do you have any objection to psychological tests?
Say you would feel comfortable taking them.
46. Do you speak to others before they speak to you?
The interviewer is probably trying to determine your ability to deal with unstable or
unanticipated situations.
• Say that your actions depend on specific circumstances.
• While you wouldn’t normally start a conversation with a stranger on the street, for
example, you feel comfortable initiating discussions with people you don’t know in
normal business or social settings.
47. What was the last book you read? Movie you saw? Sporting event you attended?
Try to show that you lead a balanced life when answering questions about outside activities.
48. Are you creative?
Be prepared with work related examples of creativity.
